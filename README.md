# Ideal-Vending-Machine-
Project Title: Design and Implementation of an Ideal Vending Machine using Mealy State Diagram and Verilog. 

Project Description:

This project involves designing and implementing a digital vending machine system utilizing a Mealy state diagram in the context of digital electronics and logic design. The vending machine will be modeled using Verilog, a hardware description language, and tested on the EDA Playground platform.

Objectives:

Mealy State Diagram Design: Develop a Mealy state diagram to define the state transitions and output logic for the vending machine. The state diagram will account for various states such as idle, accepting money, dispensing items, and handling errors.
Verilog Implementation: Translate the Mealy state diagram into Verilog code, creating a hardware model of the vending machine. This implementation will include modules for state management, input handling, and output control.
Simulation and Verification: Utilize EDA Playground to simulate the Verilog code and verify the correct operation of the vending machine. This will involve testing various scenarios to ensure accurate behavior and functionality.
Key Features:

State Management: Accurate representation of state transitions based on inputs (e.g., coin insertion, button presses) and outputs (e.g., item dispensing, change return).
Error Handling: Mechanisms to handle invalid inputs and out-of-stock conditions.
User Interface: Basic simulation of user interactions with the vending machine.
Tools and Technologies:

Design Tools: EDA Playground for simulation and verification.
Hardware Description Language: Verilog.
State Diagram: Mealy state machine model for state transitions and outputs.
Expected Outcome:
By the end of this project, a fully functional Verilog model of an ideal vending machine will be implemented and verified through simulation, demonstrating proficiency in digital design and hardware description.
